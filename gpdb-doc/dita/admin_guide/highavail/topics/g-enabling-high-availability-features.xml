      <note type="important">When data loss is not acceptable for a Greenplum Database cluster,
         Greenplum master and segment mirroring is recommended. If mirroring is not enabled then
         Greenplum stores only one copy of the data, so the underlying storage media provides the
         only guarantee for data availability and correctness in the event of a hardware failure.<p
            otherprops="pivotal">Kubernetes enables quick recovery from both pod and host failures,
            and Kubernetes storage services provide a high level of availability for the underlying
            data. Furthermore, virtualized environments make it difficult to ensure the
            anti-affinity guarantees required for Greenplum mirroring solutions. For these reasons,
            mirrorless deployments are fully supported with Greenplum for Kubernetes. Other
            deployment environments are generally not supported for production use unless both
            Greenplum master and segment mirroring are enabled.</p></note>
