    <p>Greenplum Database offers two different methods for text search and analytics, <b>Greenplum
        Database full text search</b> and <b>Pivotal GPText</b>.</p>
    <section>
      <title>Greenplum Database Full Text Search</title>
    <p>Greenplum Database text search is PostgreSQL text search ported to the Greenplum Database MPP
      platform.  Greenplum Database text search is immediately available to you, with no need to
      install and maintain additional software. For full details on this topic, see <xref
        href="../admin_guide/textsearch/intro.xml" format="dita" scope="peer">Greenplum Database
        text search</xref>.</p>

      <title>Pivotal GPText</title>
    
    <p>For advanced text analysis applications, Pivotal also offers <xref
        href="http://gptext.docs.pivotal.io/330/topics/intro.html" format="html" scope="external"
          ><b>Pivotal GPText</b></xref>, which integrates Greenplum Database with the Apache Solr
      text search platform. GPText installs an Apache Solr cluster alongside your Greenplum Database
      cluster and provides Greenplum Database functions you can use to create Solr indexes, query
      them, and receive results in the database session.</p>
    <p>Both of these systems provide powerful, enterprise-quality document indexing and searching
        services. GPText, with Solr, has many capabilities that are not available with Greenplum
        Database text search. In particular, GPText is better for advanced text analysis
        applications. For a comparative between these methods, see <xref
          href="../admin_guide/textsearch/intro.xml#gptext">Comparing Greenplum Database Text Search
          with Pivotal GPText</xref>.</p>
