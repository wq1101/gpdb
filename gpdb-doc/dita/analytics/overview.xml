  <title>Overview of Greenplum Database Integrated Analytics</title>
  <body>
    <p>Greenplum offers a unique combination of a powerful, massively parallel processing (MPP)
      database and advanced data analytics. This combination creates an ideal framework for data
      scientists, data architects and business decision makers to explore artificial intelligence
      (AI), machine learning, deep learning, text analytics, and geospatial analytics.</p>

      <title>Why Greenplum Database in Integrated Analytics</title>
      <body>
      <p>The importance of advanced analytics in its various forms is growing rapidly in enterprise
        computing. Key enterprise data typically resides in relational and document form and it is
        inefficient to copy data between systems to perform analytical operations. Greenplum is able
        to run both traditional and advanced analytics workloads in-database. This integrated
        capability greatly reduces the cost and the silos created by procuring and maintaining
        multiple tools and libraries.</p>
        <p>Greenplum Database advanced analytics can be used to address a wide variety of problems
        in many verticals including automotive, finance, manufacturing, energy, government,
        education, telecommunications, on-line and traditional retail.</p>
        <p>The Greenplum analytics capabilities allow you to:</p>
    <ul id="ul_o3q_5n4_yjb">
      <li>Analyze a multitude of data types – structured, text, geospatial, and graph – in a single environment, 
        which can scale to petabytes and run algorithms designed for parallelism.  </li>
      <li>Leverage existing SQL knowledge: Pivotal Greenplum can run dozens of statistical, 
        machine learning, and graph methods, via SQL.</li>
      <li>Train more models in less time by taking advantage of the parallelism in the MPP
        architecture and in-database analytics.</li>
      <li>Access the data where it lives, therefore integrate data and analytics in one place. 
        Pivotal Greenplum is infrastructure-agnostic and runs on  bare metal, private cloud, and public 
        cloud deployments.</li>
      <li>Use a multitude of data extensions. Greenplum supports Apache <xref
            href="https://greenplum.docs.pivotal.io/streaming-server/1-3-6/intro.html" format="html" scope="external"
            >Kafka integration</xref>, extensions for HDFS, Hive, and HBase as well as
          reading/writing data from/to cloud storage, including Amazon S3 objects. Review the
          capabilities of Greenplum <xref href="https://gpdb.docs.pivotal.io/6-1/pxf/intro_pxf.html"
            format="html" scope="external">Platform Extension Framework (PXF)</xref>, which provides
            <i>connectors</i> that enable you to access data stored in sources external to your
          Greenplum Database deployment.</li>
      <li otherprops="Pivotal">Use familiar and leading BI and advanced analytics software that are ODBC/JDBC compatible, or have native integrations,
        including SAS, IBM Cognos, SAP Analytics Solutions, Qlik, Tableau, Apache Zeppelin, and Jupyter.</li>
      <li>Execute deep learning algorithms using popular frameworks like Keras and TensorFlow in an
          MPP relational database, with GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) acceleration.</li>
      <li>Use containers capable of isolating executors from the host OS. Greenplum PL/Container implements
        a trusted language execution engine which permits customized data science workloads or environments created
        for different end user workloads.</li>
       <li>Use procedural languages to customize your analytics. Pivotal Greenplum supports development in R, 
         Python, Java, and other standard languages allowing you to distribute execution across the entire cluster
         to take advantage of the scale and parallelism.</li>
