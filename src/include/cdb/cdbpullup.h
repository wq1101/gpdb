/*
 * cdbpullup_expr
 *
 * Suppose there is a Plan node 'P' whose projection is defined by
 * a targetlist 'TL', and which has subplan 'S'.  Given TL and an
 * expr 'X0' whose Var nodes reference the result columns of S, this
 * function returns a new expr 'X1' that is a copy of X0 with Var nodes
 * adjusted to reference the columns of S after their passage through P.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *      expr -> X0, the expr in terms of the subplan S's targetlist
 *      targetlist -> TL (a List of TargetEntry), the plan P's targetlist
 *              (or can be a List of Expr)
 *      newvarlist -> an optional List of Expr which may contain Var nodes
 *              referencing the result of the projection.  The Var nodes in
 *              the new expr are copied from ones in this list if possible,
 *              to get their varnoold and varoattno settings.
 *      newvarno = varno to be used in new Var nodes
 *
 * When calling this function on an expr which has NOT yet been transformed
 * by set_plan_references(), newvarno should be the RTE index assigned to
 * the result of the projection.
 *
 * When calling this function on an expr which HAS been transformed by
 * set_plan_references(), newvarno should usually be OUTER; or 0 if the
 * expr is to be used in the targetlist of an Agg or Group node.
 *
 * At present this function doesn't support pull-up from a subquery into a
 * containing query: there is no provision for adjusting the varlevelsup
 * field in Var nodes for outer references.  This could be added if needed.
 *
 * Returns X1, the expr recast in terms of the given targetlist; or
 * NULL if X0 references a column of S that is not projected in TL.

/*
 * cdbpullup_makeVar
 *
 * Returns a new Var node with given 'varno' and 'varattno', and varlevelsup=0.
 *
 * The caller must provide an 'oldexpr' from which we obtain the vartype and
 * vartypmod for the new Var node.  If 'oldexpr' is a Var node, all fields are
 * copied except for varno, varattno and varlevelsup.
 *
 * The parameter modifyOld determines if varnoold and varoattno are modified or
 * not. Rule of thumb is to use modifyOld = false if called before setrefs.
 *
 * Copying an existing Var node preserves its varnoold and varoattno fields,
 * which are used by EXPLAIN to display the table and column name.
 * Also these fields are tested by equal(), so they may need to be set
 * correctly for successful lookups by list_member(), tlist_member(),
 * make_canonical_pathkey(), etc.
