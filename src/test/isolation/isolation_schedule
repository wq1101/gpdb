# GPDB_91_MERGE_FIXME: GPDB acquires ExclusiveLock for update and delete SQL
# statements.  This invalidates most of the isolation tests from upstream below.
# E.g. an UPDATE step executed by isolationtester never returns because another
# session run in the same permutation holds ExclusiveLock that blocks the step.
# GPDB_94_MERGE_FIXME: Since the introduction of Global Deadlock Detector, an
# UPDATE/DELETE no longer acquires ExclusiveLock. So we could perhaps enable
# some of these now. 
# A GUC gp_enable_global_deadlock_detector is introduced to control GDD.
# When GDD is enabled, update|delete on heap tables will lock the table in
# RowExclusiveLock mode. Otherwise, it locks the whole table in ExlusiveLock mode.
# By default, GDD is set distabled and most the cases are tested under this
# condition.
# Greenplum's logic for Select-Statement with locking clause (for update|no key update|share|key share)
# is different from upstream:
#   - For all kinds of select-statement with locking clause, Greenplum locks the entire table in ExclusiveLock
#   mode, and does not generate LockRows plannode in the plan.
#   - For very simple cases (defined below), Greenplum behaves just like Postgres:
#     1. Hold RowShareLock on the table
#     2. Generate LockRows plannode in the plan
#     3. Lock tuples during executing

# Simple cases should meet all the following conditions:
#   1. GDD(global deadlock detector) is enabled
#   2. Top level select statements with locking clause
#   3. FromList in the parse tree contains and only contains one rangeVar
#   4. No sublink and no subquery
#   5. No set operations (union, intersect, â€¦)

# GPDB_95_MERGE_FIXME: Tests insert-conflict-do-update-3,
# nowait, nowait-2, nowait-3, nowait-4, nowait-5, skip-locked, skip-locked-2,
# skip-locked-3, skip-locked-4, tuplelock-conflict, alter-table-2,
# alter-table-2, create-trigger. If GDD is enabled, it will then take
# RowExclusiveLock and the tests can probably be enabled back.
# Additionally, skip-locked-4 uses pg_advisory_lock() which only takes the lock
# on QD, but it needs to take it on QE segments as well.
# GPDB_95_MERGE_FIXME: insert-conflict-do-nothing, insert-conflict-do-update,
# and insert-conflict-do-update-2 fail because isolationtester does not include
# QEs when checking pg_locks. If we are able to add the QE backend pids of gang
# to this list then these tests can be enabled.  insert-conflict-do-update-2
# has additional issue where GPDB does not support creating unique indexes on
# mutated columns via lower().
