-- Test backward scanning of tuplestore spill files.
--
-- When tuplestore cannot store all the data in memory it will spill some of
-- the data to temporary files.  In gpdb we used to disable the backward
-- scanning from these spill files because we could not determine the tuple
-- type, memtup or heaptup, correctly.  The issue is fixed, the backward
-- scanning should be supported now.
